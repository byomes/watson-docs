## What Is Watson

Watson is Dr. Bill Yomes's personal AI assistant system — not a single bot, but an orchestrated ecosystem of jobs, hardware, and interfaces. Watson does not use sub-agents. Watson runs **jobs**.

Watson acts on Dr. Bill's behalf under his supervision. Always identified openly as Watson. Never pastors, counsels, or speaks theologically without permission. Never guesses. Terse, efficient, direct.

**Non-negotiable constraints:**
- No hallucination. If Watson does not know, Watson says so and stops.
- Not an image bearer. No soul, no Holy Spirit access, no spiritual authority under any framing.
- Clarity over assumption. When clarification is needed, ask one specific question and wait.

## Hardware

### Beelink EQi12 — Primary Watson Server (LIVE)

- **Specs:** Intel i5 12th gen, 32GB DDR4, 500GB NVMe
- **OS:** Linux Mint XFCE
- **Hostname:** `watson` / **User:** `billyomes`
- **Local IP:** `192.168.1.204`
- **Tailscale IP:** `100.117.237.96`
- **Tailscale hostname:** `watson.tail0243ff.ts.net`
- **SSH:** `ssh billyomes@watson` or `ssh billyomes@192.168.1.204`
- **Tailscale Funnel:** `https://watson.tail0243ff.ts.net` → publicly reachable → proxies to `http://localhost:5200`
- **Dashboard:** Flask app, port 5200, `watson-dashboard.service`
- **Ollama:** Bound to `0.0.0.0`. Models: `llama3.2:3b` (primary chat/intent), `qwen2.5-coder:7b` (Dev Loop, KB, structured reasoning), `qwen2.5:7b` (accuracy-sensitive background jobs — pastoral notes, email drafts, task/goal extraction, State of Church synthesis, skill/capability audits), `phi3:mini` (background tasks), `gemma3:1b` (fast/lightweight)

### FMSPC — Windows Desktop (GPU Tasks Only)

- **Specs:** RTX 3070 Ti (8GB VRAM), 128GB RAM
- **Role:** Whisper transcription only.
- **Whisper:** faster-whisper, Whisper Large-v3
- **Not always-on.** FMSPC env vars left in `.env` for future use.
- **⚠️ FMSPC is excluded from Watson's automated job loop, permanently — standing
  decision, not a temporary state.** No cron job, Telegram-triggered job, or
  dashboard-triggered job may call an Ollama model hosted on FMSPC. Every
  automated Ollama call must target the Beelink's own `localhost:11434` with a
  model sized for the Beelink (32GB RAM, no dedicated GPU) — see LLM Stack
  below. Root cause history: `qwen2.5:14b` (9GB, 14.8B params) was originally
  routed to FMSPC for "accuracy-sensitive" jobs, but FMSPC isn't always on, so
  in practice those jobs silently fell back to requesting `qwen2.5:14b` against
  the Beelink's own `localhost:11434` instead — loading a model that heavy into
  the Beelink's RAM starved concurrent Ollama calls (e.g. simple intent
  classification) of scheduling priority, causing intermittent multi-second-to-
  60+-second hangs across unrelated Telegram queries. Traced and fixed
  2026-07-16 (12 files moved to `qwen2.5:7b` on the Beelink); this note exists
  because the fix has been lost between sessions once already — if a future
  build proposes routing any automated job to FMSPC, that is the bug, not a
  valid solution.

  **2026-07-17 update:** `OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS` was raised from `1` to `3`
  today (`/etc/systemd/system/ollama.service.d/override.conf`). This fixes
  *part* of the original hang mechanism — with `=1`, requesting a second model
  while a heavy one was loaded forced an evict-and-reload cycle (cold loads
  measured 22–80s in `memory/model_benchmark_20260715.md`), which was likely
  the dominant cause of the observed 60+-second stalls. With `=3`, the intent
  classifier and a heavy background-job model can now stay resident
  simultaneously without thrashing.

  **This does NOT fully resolve the original risk.** `OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL` is
  still `1` — Ollama still serializes all generate requests one at a time,
  system-wide, regardless of how many models are resident in memory. A
  long-running call on a heavy model still blocks every other Ollama request
  (including intent classification) for its full duration.

  Because of that gap, `qwen2.5:14b` remains off every Beelink job for now —
  **not because the 2026-07-16 fix failed**, but because concurrent-load
  behavior was never re-tested after the `MAX_LOADED_MODELS` change. (A
  same-day attempt to reintroduce `qwen2.5:14b` into `state_of_church.py` and
  `draft_email.py` was made and then reverted before being committed — see the
  commit that added this note.) Before `qwen2.5:14b` is reconsidered for any
  job, someone needs to actually test it under real concurrent load: fire a
  real Telegram message through `classify()` while a long `qwen2.5:14b` call
  is mid-run, and confirm `classify()`'s 10s timeout/fallback (bug #20,
  `56d60dd`) behaves correctly under that real contention — not just in
  isolation.

### PBLaptop — Windows Laptop

- Secondary machine. OneDrive synced. No Ollama.

### HP Stream — RETIRED

- Offline. Replaced by Beelink.

## Active Services (Beelink systemd)

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `watson-bot.service` | Telegram bot |
| `watson-dashboard.service` | Flask dashboard, port 5200 |

Deploy pattern: `cd ~/watson && git pull && sudo systemctl restart watson-bot.service watson-dashboard.service`

---

## LLM Stack

| Layer | Tool | Use |
|-------|------|-----|
| Claude.ai | This interface | Strategy, architecture, spec, writing |
| Claude Code | `--dangerously-skip-permissions` on Beelink | File editing, building, committing |
| `llama3.2:3b` | Beelink Ollama | Primary Watson chat (Telegram general-chat fallback), session summarization |
| `gemma3:4b` | Beelink Ollama | Intent classification (Telegram only, `jobs/intent/classifier.py`) — swapped from `llama3.2:3b` 2026-07-17 (bug #20, `56d60dd`); `keep_alive=30m` plus `jobs/intent/keep_warm.py` cron (every 4 min) keep it resident |
| `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | Beelink Ollama | Dev Loop, KB search, structured reasoning |
| `qwen2.5:7b` | Beelink Ollama | Accuracy-sensitive background jobs: pastoral notes, meeting/note task+goal extraction, email drafts, State of Church synthesis, skill/capability audits, elder-review meeting summaries |
| `phi3:mini` | Beelink Ollama | Background tasks |
| `gemma3:1b` | Beelink Ollama | Fast/lightweight queries |

**No Claude API calls in automated Watson jobs.** Ollama handles all automated inference.

**Retired — `qwen2.5:14b` (FMSPC Ollama):** was listed here for "accuracy-sensitive"
jobs, but FMSPC isn't always on, so those jobs actually ran `qwen2.5:14b` against
the *Beelink's* `localhost:11434` — a 9GB/14.8B-param model too heavy for the
Beelink, which starved concurrent Ollama calls and caused intermittent
multi-second-to-60+-second hangs (root-caused 2026-07-16). Replaced by
`qwen2.5:7b` on the Beelink across all 12 call sites. See the FMSPC note under
Hardware — FMSPC is excluded from the automated job loop entirely, permanently.
Still off every Beelink job as of 2026-07-17 despite that day's
`OLLAMA_MAX_LOADED_MODELS` bump — see the 2026-07-17 update under the FMSPC
note for why that change isn't sufficient on its own to bring it back.

## Integrations

| Service | Purpose | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Google Calendar | Scheduling, booking, pre-meeting briefs, wcky `/meet` availability + booking | OAuth2 (Watson-Web client, `watson-498401` project), `~/watson/config/token.json`, scope: Calendar. Shared by wcky's Vercel env vars — not a separate credential. |
| Gmail IMAP | Connect cards, email intake, reply handler | `watson.wcky@gmail.com` |
| Gmail SMTP | Outbound email | `smtp.gmail.com:587`, sends as `watson@williamckyomes.com` alias |
| Telegram | Primary away interface | `@wckyWatsonbot`, `watson-bot.service` |
| Kit (v3 + v4) | Email platform | v3: `api_key` query param + `api_secret` in body; v4: `X-Kit-Api-Key` header |
| Givebutter | Donor sync | Polls transactions → `donors.db` → Kit tags → Gmail thank-you |
| Subsplash | Connect cards | Forwards to `watson.wcky@gmail.com` label via snappages.com |
| Tailscale Funnel | Public Watson API access | `https://watson.tail0243ff.ts.net` → port 5200 |
| Vercel | Web hosting | Auto-deploy on push to `main` for all web repos |
| Upstash KV | Legacy — TWJ reader credentials only | Writing Room and blog drafts now use watson.db |
| Bible API | Scripture lookup | `api.scripture.api.bible` — NIV, CSB, NASB |
| Serper.dev | Web search | Used in KB and research jobs |
| Scribbl | Meet transcripts | Chrome extension → auto-emails transcript to `watson.wcky@gmail.com` post-call |
| OneDrive | Nightly backup | rclone `Watson-Backup` remote, 3am cron — backs up data/, config/, kb/chroma/, kb/documents/, .env |
| FlareSolverr | Cloudflare JS challenge bypass | `localhost:8191`, persistent Docker container (`docker run -d --name=flaresolverr --restart unless-stopped`, not systemd). Used by `jobs/curator/research.py` for romance.io only (`_FLARESOLVERR_DOMAINS`) — resolves project_backlog id=18. `jobs/research/gutenberg.py` does NOT route through it — its `search()` already works via a self-hosted local Gutendex instance (`gutendex.service`, `127.0.0.1:8010`, since 2026-07-15) and `download_and_ingest()` downloads text directly from gutenberg.org; neither hits the Cloudflare-blocked public gutendex.com. That self-hosted catalog has its own staleness gap (no refresh job — see project_backlog, new item added 2026-07-22) unrelated to Cloudflare. |

---

## Congregation Management

### Member Status System (`member_status` column)
- `active` — normal reporting (default)
- `deceased` — permanent exclusion from all reports
- `disconnected` — excluded from reporting; auto-reinstated via Telegram if they attend again
- `non_local` — never flagged as missing, stays in system
- `snowbird` — not flagged as missing, optional return date for auto-reinstatement

All non-active statuses excluded from: missed report, shepherding report, State of the Church members-not-seen list.

### Campus Classification (`campus_preference` column)
Values: `Wilmington`, `Online`, `Hybrid`

**Classifier logic** (`jobs/connect_cards/campus_classifier.py`, runs Mon 5:45am):
1. Count Online vs Wilmington connect cards in last 56 days
2. Both ≥ 2 → Hybrid
3. Either ≥ 5 (not hybrid) → that campus
4. Middle zone → whichever is higher; Wilmington tiebreak
5. No cards in 8 weeks → Wilmington

Manual override available in dashboard Member Management panel.

### Missed Report Sections
Three sections, each suppressed if empty: WILMINGTON CAMPUS / ONLINE CAMPUS / HYBRID CAMPUS

### Conflict Resolution
Sunday 5pm Telegram report with 3-button resolution: Keep Old / Keep New / Skip
Dashboard trigger available: "Run Conflict Check" in More tab.

---

## Dev Loop

- Runs locally on Beelink via `subprocess.Popen` (non-blocking)
- Script: `~/watson/jobs/dev_loop/loop.py`
- Trigger: `jobs/dev_loop/trigger.py` — called from Telegram `devloop:` command (no dashboard UI trigger since 2026-07-01)
- Ollama model: `qwen2.5-coder:7b` at `localhost:11434`
- Test method: syntax check only (`python3 -m py_compile`) — not execution
- Callback: `POST /api/dev-loop/callback` with `X-Watson-Key: WRITING_ROOM_API_KEY`
- Dashboard: no UI tab as of 2026-07-01 (removed from More menu, TWJ/ARC consolidation) — `/api/dev-loop/*` routes still live, reachable directly, just no dashboard entry point
- Logs: `~/watson/logs/devloop-{slug}.log`
- Cleanup: `jobs/dev_loop/cleanup.py` — Monday 4am, purges projects older than 7 days
- Stuck-running handling (`jobs/dev_loop/cleanup.py`): `auto_fail_stuck_running()` runs before the 7-day purge — checks `ps -eo args` for a live `loop.py --slug <slug>` process, and any `dev_projects` row still `'running'` past 2h with no matching process is auto-marked `'failed'` and reported via Telegram. Complements the pre-existing `flag_stuck_running()`, which is read-only and alerts at a 24h threshold without changing status.
- Projects staged to `~/watson/dev/<slug>/` — never auto-committed to main

## Writing Room (`williamckyomes.com/room`)

Private community hub for Writing Room Partners (invitation-only, earned via ARC completion).

**Architecture:** Next.js pages on wcky site → Watson API → `watson.db`
**Watson API base:** `https://watson.tail0243ff.ts.net` (Tailscale Funnel)
**Auth:** `X-Watson-Key` header shared secret (`WRITING_ROOM_API_KEY`)

**Partner funnel:** ARC signup (`/arc`) → complete 5 commitments → Writing Room invitation
**ARC commitments** (`src/app/arc/page.tsx`):
1. Pray for the book's impact
2. Read the book before the launch date
3. Post an honest review on Amazon on launch day
4. Share about the book on at least one social media platform
5. Tell people in your life who you think would connect with this book
**Kit tags:** `arc-reader`, `arc-complete`, `writing-room-partner`

**Sections:** Board (threaded posts), Beta (draft feedback), Read (ARC manuscript), Prayer (prayer wall), Write (direct message to William), Calls (upcoming video calls)
**Admin:** `/room/admin` — William's read-only view. Auth via `WRITING_ROOM_ADMIN_USER` / `WRITING_ROOM_ADMIN_PASS`.

**Watson job files:**
- `jobs/writing_room/monitor.py` — polls tables, fires Telegram alerts
- `jobs/writing_room/onboard.py` — approval flow, credentials, welcome email, Kit tag
- `jobs/writing_room/reset.py` — password reset token flow
- `jobs/writing_room/remind.py` — video call reminders to all partners
- `jobs/writing_room/api.py` — Flask blueprint, routes registered on dashboard app

---

## Body Composition Tracker (bodyrec)

`bodyrec.vercel.app` — body composition tracker with separate bill/mel profiles.

**Architecture:** Next.js frontend (`~/bodyrec`) → Watson API → `watson.db`
**Watson API base:** `https://watson.tail0243ff.ts.net` (Tailscale Funnel)
**Auth:** `X-Watson-Key` header shared secret — same pattern as Writing Room
**Watson job file:** `jobs/bodyrec/api.py` — Flask blueprint, routes registered on dashboard app
**Tables:** `body_entries`, `body_settings`
**Supabase:** Fully retired for this project — all data and API needs route through Watson (`watson.db`), no Supabase dependency remains.

---

## The Wrong Jesus (Book)

- **Status:** Manuscript complete. Reader retired from `/twj/read` (2026-07-01, TWJ/ARC consolidation) — now read via ARC manuscript reader at `/arc/dashboard`.
- **Manuscript time-lock** (`src/lib/launch-dates.ts`): unlocks 2026-07-15, closes 2026-09-14 (standalone constant, 2 hours before `TWJ_LAUNCH_DATE`, not pinned to it). Admin-preview bypass (`is_admin_preview`) available to view outside the window.
- **Manuscript gate enforcement:** Manuscript access is gated server-side via Next.js SSR in `wcky/src/app/arc/dashboard/page.tsx` (`getManuscriptStatus()`). The Watson Python backend (`jobs/arc/`) has no manuscript-serving route and is not part of this gate. Verified 2026-07-14.
- **Launch page:** `williamckyomes.com/thewrongjesus` — countdown timer, Kit signup
- **Launch page pending:** `KIT_API_KEY` + `KIT_TWJ_TAG_ID` Vercel env vars; `GIVEBUTTER_LINK`; `AMAZON_LINK`; flip `AMAZON_LIVE=true` at preorder
- **Press kit:** `williamckyomes.com/twj/press`
- **Co-editor:** Mel Yomes
- **Beta reader system:** Fully operational via watson-admin + Writing Room `/room/beta`
- **Next:** TWJ provisioning job — bulk credentials + Kit emails to ARC readers at launch

## Watson Dashboard

- **Port:** 5200 / **Service:** `watson-dashboard.service`
- **URL (local):** `http://192.168.1.204:5200`
- **URL (Tailscale):** `http://100.117.237.96:5200`
- **URL (public):** `https://watson.tail0243ff.ts.net`
- **Nav tabs:** Home, Notes, Tasks (in Team), Reminders, Reading, More
- **More menu sections (current):** Theme toggle, Briefing, Skills (command launcher), Reading List, Ministry, Events, Members, Publishing (Writing Room / ARC), Logins
- **More menu history:** "Reports" deleted 2026-06-27 (dead code removed, not merged elsewhere — `385b7fc`). "Church Events" renamed to "Events" (same feature, same `church_events` table/`/api/events`). Dev Loop section and Team Admin link removed from nav 2026-07-01, TWJ/ARC consolidation (`b5af9b1`) — UI-only cleanup, backend cron jobs/tables and `/admin` + `/api/dev-loop/*` routes untouched, just no dashboard entry point anymore.
- **Saved as iPhone PWA** — remove and re-add to Home Screen after safe area CSS changes
- **Dashboard interfaces:** `/` (Bill), `/admin` (Donna), `/team` (shared team view)

### Dashboard Routing
- SSE streaming via `/api/chat/stream`
- Skills execute immediately (no confirmation gate in dashboard)
- Telegram executes skills immediately (no gate) — this refers to `_SKILL_PRE_CHECKS`-dispatched
  skills only (routing stages 2–4 below). The six classifier-stage write intents (stage 5) are a
  separate mechanism and **do** have a confirmation gate — see Confirmation Gate below.
- Session summaries stored in `memory_sessions`; injected into system prompt on next session
- `/api/terminal` is a **separate manual command-console endpoint**, not the chat path —
  handles its own prefix set: `cdb:`, `wdb:`, `web:`, `bible:`, `polish:`, `polish this:`,
  `kb:`, `build:`, `debug:`, `run:`, plus `_TERM_COMMANDS` lookups
- `/api/chat/stream` (the actual chat path) independently reimplements its own early
  prefix intercepts — `cdb:`, `wdb:`, `web:`, `bible:`, `polish:`, `bug:`, `gutenberg:`,
  `classics:`, `build:`, `debug:`, `run:` — plus separate natural-language KB triggers
  ("search kb", "search my notes", etc.) and a time-query intercept, all ahead of the
  identity/factual/conversational checks and the shared router fallback. **All of these
  prefixes also exist on Telegram** via `_DIRECTIVE_PREFIXES` (see Telegram Bot) except
  `build:`, which has a Telegram equivalent under a different name (`devloop:`) — this
  list duplicates Telegram's, it is not a smaller subset of it.
- Anything not caught by the above falls through to `_router.route(message, "dashboard")`
  — see Shared Routing Module below.

### Shared Routing Module (`jobs/skillbuilder/router.py`)
`route(message: str, interface: str) -> dict` is the shared, interface-agnostic routing
core both `bot.py` and `/api/chat/stream` call directly (`_router.route(text, "telegram")`
and `_router.route(message, "dashboard")`). It owns `_SKILL_PRE_CHECKS` (19 entries — not
Telegram-specific despite living conceptually under "Telegram routing" in past docs),
`_BUILD_TRIGGERS`, `_AUDIT_TRIGGERS`, skill-trigger matching, and the LLM-based
`SKILL:`/`LIST_SKILLS`/`BUILD`/`PROPOSE`/`WRAP_UP`/`CHAT` fallback. No Telegram objects,
chat IDs, or reply-threading leak into it — **this already is the shared pipeline; a
future session should not assume "unifying routing" means building this from scratch.**

Both channels layer their own prefix-interception in front of it, and those layers have
drifted into real duplication rather than a capability gap: **Telegram has three
overlapping mechanisms** (`_DIRECTIVE_PREFIXES` → its own `_SKILL_PRE_CHECKS` pre-check
loop → `route()`'s internal `_SKILL_PRE_CHECKS` recheck); **dashboard has two** (its own
early intercepts → `route()`). Several prefixes (`cdb:`, `kb:`, `polish this:`,
`gutenberg:`, `classics:`, `debug:`) are matched redundantly by two or three layers on
Telegram alone. Consolidating all of this into one canonical prefix/trigger table both
channels read from is the actual routing-unification task — see Known capability gap
under Telegram Bot for what's genuinely missing (very little) versus merely duplicated
(most of it).

### Member Management (More tab)
- Full member list with search
- Per-member: status dropdown (Active/Deceased/Disconnected/Non-local/Snowbird), campus dropdown (Wilmington/Online/Hybrid), notes, snowbird return date
- Campus change saved immediately via `PATCH /api/members/<id>`

---

## Telegram Bot

- Service: `watson-bot.service`
- Primary away interface
- **Intent routing order in `bot.py`:**
  1. Pending action check (reply threading via `tg_pending_actions`)
  2. `_DIRECTIVE_PREFIXES` colon-prefix intercepts (`bot.py` ~line 618) — 15 prefixes:
     `cdb:`, `wdb:`, `kb:`, `web:`, `task:`, `note:`, `remind:`, `sms:`, `polish:`,
     `bible:`, `devloop:`, `bug:`, `gutenberg:`, `classics:`, `fireflies:`.
     Highest-priority, Telegram-only mechanism, checked before anything else.
  3. `bot.py`'s own pre-check loop over `_SKILL_PRE_CHECKS` (19 triggers, not 18 — see
     Shared Routing Module under Watson Dashboard) — dispatches 10 of those slugs to
     Telegram-specific rich handlers. Several triggers here (`cdb:`, `kb:`,
     `polish this:`, `gutenberg:`, `classics:`, `debug:`) duplicate stage 2 or 4.
  4. `_router.route(text, "telegram")` — the same shared module dashboard calls;
     re-checks `_SKILL_PRE_CHECKS` plus build/audit/wrap-up/identity/factual/skill-trigger
     logic and an LLM fallback
  5. Ollama intent classifier (`gemma3:4b`, not `llama3.2:3b` — see LLM Stack) —
     **Telegram-only, no dashboard equivalent.** Handles `contact_lookup`,
     `calendar_query`, `calendar_busy`, `calendar_availability`, `block_time`,
     `book_appointment`, `reminder_create`, `task_create`, `task_list`, `task_done`,
     `image_search`.
  6. General Ollama chat fallback (`llama3.2:3b`)

  Stages 2–4 overlap heavily — three separate mechanisms each independently re-match
  `cdb:`/`kb:`/`polish this:`/`gutenberg:`/`classics:`/`debug:`. This is duplication,
  not a capability gap; slated for consolidation into one canonical table (see Shared
  Routing Module).

### Confirmation Gate (classifier-stage write intents)

Of the 10 intents the stage-5 Ollama classifier can return, six perform a write and all
six now require an explicit **YES/NO reply before anything is written** — `contact_lookup`,
`calendar_query`, `calendar_availability`, `task_list`, and `image_search` are read-only
and were never gated (nothing to confirm).

| Intent | Gated | Bug | Reason |
|--------|-------|-----|--------|
| `block_time` | Yes | pre-existing | Writes to Google Calendar |
| `book_appointment` | Yes | pre-existing | Writes to Google Calendar + sends email |
| `calendar_busy` | Yes | #31 (2026-07-18) | Writes to Google Calendar — real safety fix; a skill-router timeout fell through to the classifier, misfired `calendar_busy`, and blocked the rest of a live day with zero confirmation before this fix |
| `task_done` | Yes | #32 (2026-07-18) | Fuzzy `LIKE %title%` `UPDATE` against existing tasks — real safety fix; an ungated misfire could silently mark unrelated/multiple tasks done with no visibility into what matched |
| `reminder_create` | Yes | #33 (2026-07-18) | Consistency addition, not a safety fix — an ungated `INSERT` is additive and trivially reversible, gated anyway for UX consistency |
| `task_create` | Yes | #33 (2026-07-18) | Same as `reminder_create` — consistency, not safety |

**Mechanism:** each handler (`_handle_block_time`, `_handle_book_appointment`,
`_handle_mark_busy`, `_handle_task_done`, `_handle_reminder_create`, `_handle_task_create`
in `bot.py`) builds a display string describing what it's about to do, calls
`pending_module.save_pending(chat_id, action_type, params, proposed_slot)`
(`jobs/gcal/pending.py`, `pending_actions` table — despite the module's `gcal` naming and
the `proposed_slot` field name, it's the generic single-pending-action-per-chat store used
by all six, not calendar-specific), and replies with a `Reply YES to confirm or NO to
cancel` prompt. `store_pending_action("calendar_booking", sent.message_id, ...)`
(`jobs/telegram/pending.py`, `tg_pending_actions` table) additionally threads the prompt
for Telegram's reply-to-message flow. A bare "yes"/"no" (checked in `bot.py`'s top-level
pre-check, not reply-threaded) or a threaded reply to the prompt both route to the same
`pending_module.get_pending(chat_id)` → `_execute_pending()` (YES) /
`pending_module.cancel_pending()` (NO) pair — `_execute_pending` dispatches on
`action_type` and only performs the actual write (Calendar API call or DB `INSERT`/`UPDATE`)
inside that function, never inside the `_handle_*` entry point. Adding a new gated write
intent means: build a display string in the handler, `save_pending()` instead of writing
directly, add a branch to `_execute_pending()`'s allowed-`action_type` tuple and dispatch —
no new infra required.

**Known capability gap (2026-07-17 routing audit, corrected):** of the classifier-stage
intents above, only **`block_time`** and **`calendar_availability`** have no dashboard
path at all. Everything else — including every `_DIRECTIVE_PREFIXES` colon-prefix
(`wdb:`, `bug:`, `web:`, `polish:` included) — is already reachable from both channels,
just via inconsistent syntax and duplicated code paths rather than a real gap.
`contact_lookup` and `reminder_create` are independently reimplemented in dashboard's
`/api/chat/stream`; `book_appointment` and `calendar_busy` exist as dedicated dashboard
REST endpoints/UI rather than chat intents. `build:` (dashboard) and `devloop:`
(Telegram) trigger the identical Dev Loop function under different spellings — a naming
mismatch, not a gap.

---

## Contact Resolution

`jobs/people/lookup.py::lookup_member(query, chat_id=None)` is the shared name-to-contact
resolver — searches `congregation.db` then `watson.db` `people`, four-step cascade (exact →
full phrase → last name → first name), each step a `LIKE` fuzzy match.

**Self-alias short-circuit:** `me`, `myself`, `my number`, `my phone` (case-insensitive,
whitespace-trimmed) never go through the fuzzy cascade — they resolve directly via exact
name match to the canonical owner record (`watson.db` `people.id=7`, "Bill Yomes"),
regardless of caller/channel. Originally gated on a Telegram `chat_id` match against
`people.telegram_chat_id` (`424af55`, 2026-07-17) — that gate meant any dashboard caller
(no `chat_id` to pass) fell through to fuzzy matching instead, which is unsafe: a fuzzy
`LIKE` search on "me" or on a mis-extracted fragment like "that to" can match an unrelated
substring (e.g. "Venuto" contains "to") and silently pick the wrong contact. Fixed 2026-07-18
(bug #34) — dropped the `chat_id` gate entirely; the short-circuit is now unconditional and
channel-agnostic. Any new caller resolving a recipient/contact string should check for
self-aliases through this same function rather than reinventing the check, or the same
failure mode reappears.

## Content Pipeline

- Sermon audio → Whisper (FMSPC) → cleanup → article → social seeds
- Articles publish Tue/Thu/Sat 10am to `williamckyomes.com/blog`
- Facebook format: `[title]\n\n[excerpt — 2 sentences max]\n\n[url]\n\n#Apologetics #Theology #Faith`
- Weekly email draft generated Thursdays → Kit delivery
- Blog draft submission: `williamckyomes.com/draft` → `POST /api/submit-draft` → `watson.db` → `scheduler.py`
- `ingest_drafts.py` retired — Upstash KV no longer in blog pipeline

---

## Personal Knowledge Base

- **Location:** `~/watson/kb/documents/` — indexed source directory
- **Contents:** Sermon transcripts, Bible study notes, handouts
- **Vector index:** ChromaDB at `~/watson/data/chroma/` — 3,792 chunks, collection `sermons`
- **Transcription pipeline output:** `~/watson/kb/transcripts/`
- **Transcription backlog:** 10 years of sermon audio on FMSPC — not yet processed
- **Sync job:** `jobs/kb/sync_and_index.py` — daily 2am: `git pull --ff-only`, moves every file in `kb/transcripts/` to `kb/documents/` the same day it arrives, incrementally indexes new documents into Chroma, Telegram summary. Supersedes retired `jobs/kb/archive_transcripts.py` (see Retired / Decided Against).

---

## Scheduling Rules

- Watson schedules Wed/Thu only for external bookings
- Mon: connect cards + sermon study
- Tue: elder 8am, staff 9am — Watson observes only
- Fri: Sabbath. Sat: family. Sun AM: church. Sun PM: light creative pipeline.
- Deep work: Wed/Thu 9am–2pm, 90-min blocks, 15-min breaks
- People always beat tasks. Tier 1 tasks immovable.
- Booking windows: Wed 10am–1pm; Thu 10am–1pm and 7–8:30pm; Sat 8–9:30am (pastoral only)

## Google Calendar

- **Auth:** OAuth2 — `~/watson/config/credentials.json` + `token.json`
- **Watson-Web OAuth client:** `717658188112-fjmm14rb3asfutnppql2dldftpd1djc5.apps.googleusercontent.com`, GCP project `watson-498401`, publish status "In production"
- **Calendar ID:** `bill.yomes@gmail.com`
- **Scope:** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` (Calendar only — `token.json`'s `scopes` field and the actual `/gcal-auth` authorization call both confirm this; a `gmail.send` entry exists in an unused constant in `app.py` but is never requested)
- **Token health check:** Daily 7am (`jobs/gcal/token_health.py`) — checks Watson's own `token.json` only
- **Reauth (Watson):** `/gcal-auth` web route in dashboard app, or `jobs/gcal/reauth.py` (terminal flow) — both write to `~/watson/config/token.json`

### wcky `/meet` — shares Watson-Web's OAuth client (as of 2026-07-13)

`williamckyomes.com/meet` (`src/app/api/meet/availability/route.ts` and `book/route.ts`, on Vercel) calls Google Calendar **directly from the Vercel serverless function** — it does not route through Watson/Tailscale Funnel at all. It used to run on its own separate OAuth client (`...nb0j56bqpb68g1mbn5oi0lorvkk9g302...`), which had its grant silently revoked on the Google account side and broke repeatedly with no monitoring in place to catch it. It has been migrated to **reuse Watson-Web's OAuth client** above — one client for Bill's calendar, not two.

- **wcky Vercel env vars** (`GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` — Production + Preview, all type `sensitive` so their values can't be read back via `vercel env pull`/API once set) now hold Watson-Web's client_id/secret and a refresh token minted independently for wcky (does not live in `~/watson/config/token.json` — separate token instance, same client, same scope).
- **Reauth (wcky only):** `~/watson/scripts/wcky_meet_reauth.py` — one-time standalone script, deliberately *not* wired to Watson's `token.json`. Mints a fresh refresh token via a local-loopback OAuth flow (`http://localhost:8765/`, registered as an extra redirect URI on the Watson-Web client for exactly this purpose) and prints it to the terminal for manual copy into Vercel. Run this, then update `GOOGLE_REFRESH_TOKEN` in Vercel (wcky project) and redeploy, if `/meet` availability ever breaks again.
- **Health check:** Daily 7am (`jobs/gcal/meet_token_health.py`) — unlike `token_health.py`, this does a live HTTP probe of `https://www.williamckyomes.com/api/meet/availability?duration=30` and confirms real slot data comes back, since wcky's credential lives entirely in Vercel and isn't visible to any local check. Alerts via the same Telegram path as `token_health.py`.
- **Old client not yet deleted:** `...nb0j56bqpb68g1mbn5oi0lorvkk9g302...` still exists in Google Cloud Console (`watson-498401`), kept intentionally for a few days post-migration before manual deletion — do not delete without checking with Bill first.

## Development Conventions

- **Design:** Claude.ai (this interface)
- **Build:** Claude Code on Beelink (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`)
- **Deploy:** Claude Code commits + pushes → Vercel auto-deploys / Bill manually pulls Watson
- **Claude Code never SSHes.** Bill always pulls and restarts services manually.
- **Sudo access:** Claude Code has exactly one passwordless sudo permission — restarting
  watson-dashboard.service and watson-bot.service (via /etc/sudoers.d/watson-restart).
  No other sudo command is permitted under any circumstances.
- **sed vs Claude Code:** ≤3 steps use sed. 4+ steps go to Claude Code.
- **PYTHONPATH:** Always inline in cron — `PYTHONPATH=/home/billyomes/watson` — do not rely on standalone crontab variable.
- **Ghost directory danger:** Never name job directories after Python stdlib modules. `jobs/calendar/` → renamed `jobs/gcal/`. `jobs/email/` → renamed `jobs/email_job/`.
- **Ollama async:** All Ollama calls in bot must use `asyncio.to_thread()`. Never bare `requests.post()` in async context.
- **Kit API:** v3 and v4 require separate credentials. v3 tag creation: nested `{"tag": {"name": "..."}}`. v3 auth: `api_key` query param for GET, `api_secret` in POST body. v4: `X-Kit-Api-Key` header.
- **httpx pin:** Must stay at `0.25.2` for `python-telegram-bot 20.7` compatibility.
- **`/twj/read`:** Retired 2026-07-01 (TWJ/ARC consolidation) — now redirects to `/arc/dashboard`. Manuscript reading lives under ARC (`ManuscriptReader.tsx`).
- **Two-database architecture:** `congregation.db` for all pastoral/church data; `watson.db` for Watson system data. Jobs must target the correct DB.
- **Direct Python over Ollama for structured DB queries:** `cdb:` pattern matcher is more reliable than LLM SQL generation. Ollama falls through/times out on structured queries.
- **`_SKILL_PRE_CHECKS` and `skills.json` are independent:** Both must be updated when adding/changing skills.
- **New skill builds:** always append to `commands.json`; Watson maintains that file.
- **Windows git:** `git pull` can fail with `mmap failed` — use `git fetch origin` then `git reset --hard origin/main`.
- **PowerShell:** No `&&` chaining. No `grep` — use `Get-ChildItem | Select-String`.
- **Gemini permanently removed from coding loop** — caused file corruption.

## Active Bugs

Tracked in the `bug_tracker` table (`watson.db`) — see the dashboard Issues tab, not this file. Open on discovery, resolved with a `commit_hash` once the fix is actually committed.

### Known limitation — KB search excerpt trimming (added 2026-07-08)

The 500-char excerpt window in `kb_search.py` centers on literal query-term proximity (first substring match of a query word in the chunk), not semantic relevance. Synthesis quality will degrade on queries where the underlying concept is present in a chunk but the exact search term doesn't appear near it in the source text. Not currently a fix target — noted for awareness only.

---

## Pre-Tracker Resolved Items (reconciled 2026-07-12)

Bugs surfaced in Claude.ai conversation history predating the `bug_tracker` table (created 2026-07-09, `4ba9e30`) and confirmed fixed against current code during a 2026-07-12 reconciliation pass. Not backfilled as `bug_tracker` rows — they were already closed before the table existed, and inserting them now would misrepresent the table's actual discovery-to-fix usage history. Logged here instead for a complete record.

| Item | Resolved | Commit |
|------|----------|--------|
| Dashboard briefing tab buttons not fully functional | 2026-06-11 | `f4fda9a` |
| Scheduler publishing drafts immediately instead of queuing | 2026-05-11 | `f6bb959` |
| Facebook queue confirmation message too verbose | 2026-05-17 | `179700d` |
| `run:image_search` routing to QR generator instead of image search | 2026-06-10 | `fee3d1d` |
| `kb/transcripts` gitignore / broken Telegram URL on archiving | 2026-06-20 (superseded by rewrite) | `2324529` |
| `.btn-save` CSS renders blue on briefing static template | 2026-06-04 | `7c6e4bc` |
| `pastoral_notes` insert schema mismatch (`person_id` etc.) | 2026-06-20 | `61f0de7` |
| Task handler silently swallows exceptions, no Telegram error reply | 2026-07-09 | `2bea12f` |

## Retired / Decided Against

- ~~Sub-agents (Charles, Jenny, Mark)~~ — Watson runs jobs, no agent personas
- ~~Write interface (`write.wcky.com`)~~ — Bill writes in Google Docs
- ~~MiniMax M3 local deployment~~ — requires data center hardware
- ~~Open WebUI~~ — replaced by Watson dashboard
- ~~watson-ui as primary interface~~ — deprioritized
- ~~Gemini in coding loop~~ — caused file corruption, permanently removed
- ~~Windows machine for web development~~ — all web dev now on Beelink
- ~~Upstash KV in blog pipeline~~ — `ingest_drafts.py` retired, direct POST to Flask
- ~~FMSPC SSH for Dev Loop~~ — moved to local Beelink execution
- ~~iOS keyboard patch in dashboard chat~~ — attempted and reverted 7 times, permanently removed from build queue
- ~~Build Pipeline (`jobs/dev/build_pipeline.py`)~~ — Claude API spec/review/approve flow triggered by bare `build <request>` / `approve` in Telegram; last ran 2026-06-15, superseded by Dev Loop. Bot triggers removed 2026-07-03. File left in place, unreferenced.
- ~~`jobs/kb/archive_transcripts.py`~~ — retired 2026-07-20, superseded by `jobs/kb/sync_and_index.py`. Its 30-day-old-file threshold became unreachable once transcripts started moving to `kb/documents/` the same day they arrive. File left in place, unreferenced; cron entry removed.

## Recent Changes — 2026-07-05

### ~/watson
- feat: `thesis_snapshots` id=2 inserted — second all-time snapshot (May 20–Jul 5 2026), 52 downloads/18 views/20 countries, pulled by hand from Digital Commons dashboard. Via throwaway script, not committed.
- data correction: `thesis_countries` snapshot_id=2 was initially entered with only 19 of 20 countries (South Africa omitted). Added South Africa (1 download) after confirming it still shows on the live dashboard — country sum now matches `total_downloads` (52) exactly, no gap. `raw_json` note on the snapshot corrected to match (previously described the gap as an "unattributable download," which was wrong — it was just the missing country row). Direct `sqlite3` data fix via throwaway script, no code changes.
- data correction: `thesis_countries` snapshot_id=1 (all-time backfill, May 20–Jul 4 2026) was originally entered with only 5 of 20 countries. Replaced with full 20-country list; corrected `thesis_snapshots.total_countries` from 19→20 (was miscounted at backfill time). `total_downloads` (51) unchanged — United States corrected from 24→23 to match. Direct `sqlite3` data fix, no script file, no code changes.
